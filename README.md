# ArtWork

## The Goal

The goal for this project is to create a completely realized artwork portfolio for myself that I can access online. I sport an iPhone 6 these days, so as you can imagine space is limited. Next time I'm trying to show a friend my artwork I'll be able to without having to delete GBs of data so get my photos to render correctly. 

## Live Demo

This project is still in the early phases of production so there is no live demo at this point in time.
